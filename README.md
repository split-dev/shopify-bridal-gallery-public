Project Objectives:
1. Transform Prototypes:
We converted Figma prototypes into a fully functional Shopify website, prioritizing intuitive navigation, mobile responsiveness, and conversion optimization.

2. Solve Technical Challenges:
Integrating intricate Figma designs into Shopify required HTML, CSS, and Liquid programming for pixel-perfect rendering. Custom animations and transitions were added to increase engagement and uphold design consistency.

Special Features Implemented:
1. Navigation and Checkout:
The site features a comprehensive product catalog, a streamlined checkout process with multiple payment options, and a user-friendly navigation menu.

2. Lookbook and Booking System:
A lookbook visualizes wedding styles, while the booking system allows scheduling appointments. Learn more about our detailed case studies.
